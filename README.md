# Worthwhile Ideas

Ideas worth building are kind of hard to come by, so here'a bunch that are under development or need initialization.


## Solana

### Anchor for Indexing

Need a standard way for indexing on-chain state & actions so that way apps can have a standard way to access each other's state.

IMHO this is a huge blocker for composability.

### Anchor getter/setter functions for on-chain state

It would be nice if boiler plate instructions can be generated for state (init, set, get/verify)


## Stable Diffusion

### Stable diffusion meme generator

Fine tune stable diffusion to produce memes like output from [Img Flip's memegen](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator)

### Put yourself into your NFTs

... i don't know why I haven't seen variants of this on twitter yet...
